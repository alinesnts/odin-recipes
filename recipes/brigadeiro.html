    <p>Brigadeiros are a beloved Brazilian sweet, traditionally made from condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles. They have a rich, fudgy texture and a deep chocolate flavor, rolled into small bite-sized balls and often served in colorful paper cups. Simple in ingredients yet indulgent in taste, brigadeiros are a staple at birthday parties, celebrations, and family gatherings across Brazil.</p>
    <p>More than just a dessert, brigadeiros carry a strong sense of nostalgia and comfort. They’re usually handmade, shared among friends, and enjoyed slowly—one sweet bite at a time. Whether classic or modernized with gourmet chocolate and creative toppings, brigadeiros remain a symbol of Brazilian warmth, celebration, and home-style sweetness.</p>
